### Scripts/Components 🧩

1. **PlayerController 🕹️**

   - *Description*: This script handles the movement and control of the player character.
   - *Functionality*: It handles player input, horizontal movement, jumping, and collision detection.

2. **SceneTransition 🚀**

   - *Description*: This script manages scene transitions when the player interacts with designated triggers.
   - *Functionality*: It loads specified scenes when triggered, facilitating the movement between game levels.

3. **Extensions 🛠️**

   - *Description*: A utility class that defines an extension method for Rigidbody2D to perform raycasting.
