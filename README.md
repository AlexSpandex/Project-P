This document includes Scripts/Components, GameObjects, Scenes

### Scripts/Components

1. **PlayerController**

   - *Description*: This script handles the movement and control of the player character.
   - *Functionality*: It handles player input, horizontal movement, jumping, and collision detection.

2. **SceneTransition**

   - *Description*: This script manages scene transitions when the player interacts with designated triggers.
   - *Functionality*: It loads specified scenes when triggered, facilitating the movement between game levels.

3. **Extensions**

   - *Description*: A utility class that defines an extension method for Rigidbody2D to perform raycasting.
   - *Functionality*: This script provides an efficient way to perform raycasting with Rigidbody2D objects.

4. **SpriteRenderer**

   - *Description*: Unity's built-in component for rendering 2D sprites.
   - *Functionality*: It renders the visual representation of game objects with sprites.

5. **OnCollision2D**

   - *Description*: A Unity event triggered when two Collider2D components (e.g., player and obstacles) collide.
   - *Functionality*: It allows you to define custom behavior when collisions occur, such as player taking damage, collecting items, or triggering events.


### GameObject Composition

#### Brick (Block)

- *Components*:
  - BoxCollider2D: Defines the physical boundaries of the brick block.
  - SpriteRenderer: Renders the block's appearance with a brick texture.
  
  - *Functionality*:
    - The BoxCollider2D ensures that the brick block has a physical presence and can be interacted with.
    - The SpriteRenderer provides a visual representation, making the block appear as a brick in the game.
